Project description :

Music Lighter, (maybe lightAIR, muslight, MobLightsh?)
- a candle look-a-like
- changeable colours, shapes (maybe i.e. 4 to choose from?)
- moving (movement as of a real one)
- sound (not necessary)
- could react on sound as well (is it possible? i.e. sizzle, hiss)... it might be used not only during the concerts, possibility to turn off the sound by one click on a screen)
- some extra feature, not sure which yetâ€¦ maybe stickers of a bands which play current concert?
- colours of a screen - changeable

Main technical questions/ deals: how big - lighter on a screen, how to switch colours (moveable screen by fingers?)
